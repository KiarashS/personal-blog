My name is Kiarash Soleimanzadeh (spelled in Persian as کیارش سلیمان زاده). I was born in Hamedan, Iran in March 1990.

I’m a software engineer and developer, experienced mainly on Microsoft technologies. Besides the professional experience, I have several research experiences on major branches of Computer Network (mainly [software-defined networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking)).

I love open-source software and would love to make my tools and utilities publicly available. I’ve been working on a stable web development methodology and technology, for both large scale and regular size web applications. That one is closed source.

I have a solid background in .NET/.NET Core technologies. When I’m not busy with that, I dabble in HTML/CSS, Angular, SQL, and Bash scripting. If I’m not developing, I’m somewhere else, thinking about developing. These technologies are my everyday breakfast, so feel free to ask for anything related.

**My Research Interests:** Big Data, Machine Learning, Electronic Commerce, Database Systems, Multimedia Systems, Software Engineering, Computer Networks, Distributed Systems.
